![Celline](/celline_icon.jpg){width=300}


Celline streamlines the entire lifecycle of public scRNA‑seq/snRNA‑seq datasets: discovery, download, metadata harmonisation, quality‑control, preprocessing and format conversion (AnnData/Seurat) – all from a single Python entry point or CLI.

It is designed for large‑scale meta‑analyses where hundreds of GEO/SRA accessions must be treated identically and reproducibly.
